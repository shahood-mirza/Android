# Android

This repository contains an Android application developed as a companion to a larger Arduino-based fingerprint doorbell security system. The application allows owners of the security system to easily pair with their device and unlock a door with the simple press of a button. Owners can also securely clear stored fingerprints by using the app and fingerprint sensor simultaneously.
